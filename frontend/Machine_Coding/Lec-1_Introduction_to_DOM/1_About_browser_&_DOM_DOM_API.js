    What is browser?

       - Software app for accessing and presenting the information for the web in human readable-format.

    Whar are the different components that make up a browser?

       - UI (User Interface)
       - Rendering Engine(used to dispaly the content of HTML and CSS)
       - JS Engine (to execute the JS code)
       - Data Strorage (store the data at client side via local storage or session storage)
       -  Networking (Where you make a request of http/https to get the data from server and render on to the browser)
       - Security (CSP, CORS)
       - Dev tool (debugging of the code or showing anything on the console.log())

    First principles

      - To implement any feature/component of a browser ->  you will get the APIs by the browser -> API are represented as an object -> contains certain methods and properties -> you will use JS to implement these APIs. 

    What is DOM and DOM API?

      - DOM (Document Object Model) -> It's a tree structure of your web page. Use to represent the whole HTML file. 

      -  DOM API  -> represents an object -> document

      - document:
          - It's a global object representing the loaded HTML document/file.
          - Acts as a bridge b/w your HTML and JS which allows the developers to interact with elements and respond to the user interactions. 

      -#document: represents the root of the HTML document.
