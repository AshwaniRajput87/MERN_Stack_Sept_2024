    <!--

   Event Bubbling:
     - it's default behavior in the DOM whenever there is an event triggered then it will propagate from the target element to its ancesator element (till the root element -> html)
     - it propagates from bottom to top.


   Event Capturing:

    - Event capturing is less commonly used and you have to registerthe capturing event explicitly.

    - it propagates the vent from top to bottom

      /**
            Thumb rule: Always use Event bubbling and try handle to it.

              1. Use Event bubbling, because it give s the sense of triggereting which current element is going to be trgirred?

              2. try to avoid to use event capturing because it may leads to confusion
