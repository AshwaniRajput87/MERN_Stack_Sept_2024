   What is fetch API?

    - It is the part of web API not the part JS itself.

    - It helps to make the API calls(GET, POST, DELETE and PUT), so that you get the dynamic data and can render that dynamic data on the browser as UI.
    
    - syntax:
       - fetch(url, options) - returns promise

       - to consume the promise from returned value of fetch (then, catch, finally or async/await)
